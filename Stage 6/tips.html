          Instructions:
          There are just two sections to the quiz. In section one, user can
          create his/her own quiz which contains a question box and four
          options. The options with the correct and wrong answers are then
          displayed in green and red colors respectively. User may get to sort
          out options randomly just before or after a question is submitted.
          This is just a teaser in order to get user all set to play. The second
          part of the app comprises of two sections; a segment for two players
          and correct/wrong buttons where players can manually increase/decrease
          scores.
        </h2>
        <h2 style="color: bisque;">
          The other segment contains a list of questions and a reveal answer
          button to display the correct/wrong options. If a player gets a
          question wrong, the other player is awarded a point. If both players
          are wrong no need to touch the correct/wrong buttons,both players can
          switch to the next question. Also,players get to search for specific
          questions by key-words as well as randomly and alphabetically sort
          questions which are just below the list of questions. When a player
          reaches 10 points, he/she wins and gets to click on a "celebate your
          win" button. Lastly, you can choose to exit the app or reload the page
          to play again.
