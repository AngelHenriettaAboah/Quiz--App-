# Quiz--App-

Stage 1 of the project which outlines what is to be done.

The most popular quiz app has become very expensive... so there came a startup that aspires to build a new one that will be better, cheaper to use and more fun! You join the startup as a developer and your task is to build a nice prototype of the product while the rest of the product team works to define what the final version will be.

Weekly specs:

JS2 week1 - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

create a form to insert a quiz question. It should take a question and 4 options for answers. There should be a way to mark which answer is correct in the form, but you should only be able to select one correct answer.

implement one of the two (or both!):

a. add a button that randomizes the order of the 4 option inputs once they have been filled in.

b. color the input for the "correct" answer option in green and the "wrong" ones in red. Make sure it's still readable.

optional bonus: make sure the question is not longer than 140 characters.
